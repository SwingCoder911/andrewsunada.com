What is it?
____________

This is a web app built to mine data services and store them in a local database for future storage.
This is currently only built to mine google's api.
Currently is only exportable into csv.

What it is missing
__________________

-I would like to add url logging
-This should be broken out into a few other classes to better describe utility
-I still need to apply a grid to this but that's less important than the rest of the functionality for now.
-Need to do some more higher level error checking (eg assuming a certain order of response arrays in some of the api calls)

-I still need to add a different sort of auto complete which allows for selecting subcategories
