Simple Checkout

What is it?
____________

This is currently a simple checkout application that applies a very basic validation to its forms.
There is currently no saving and no in depth validation.
This is meant currently as a demo of my coding abilities.

What it is missing

Were I to work on this longer, I would add input limits as a max length to the expiration date and the cvc input
I would also add number validation and I would add an option for paypal.
I might add some more colour and features to the buttons for each kind of shipping method as well.
